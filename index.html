            on to put my name down by the teachers (after i refused to do prefect or captain) and then later being like
            &ldquo;can i take my name off&rdquo; and the teacher was like &ldquo;oh no you cant. Youre the only one left
            everyone else who went for house captain got either captain or prefect&rdquo; and then having to do an speec
            which was &ldquo;hi my names jack and i like sport&rdquo; and then andrew (god i wish i remembered his last
            name, like 3 people receiving this will be the only people who know it) refused to vote for me and i legit
            was like &ldquo;oh i might get 0 votes&rdquo; but i did win and the only cool thing was i once had to run an
            assembly with will curuthers who was at the time a good foot and a half shorter than me and all the girls
            were doing a dance thing anyway this is really long jesus christ. </span></p>

    <h1>Deadpool and wolverine</h1>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Ill be honest and say i read most of the rumours and leaks for this movie and went
            &ldquo;jesus that&#39;ll be bad. But im not gonna see it&rdquo; and then a friend was like &ldquo;hey do you
            wanna go see it&rdquo; and for some reason i saw it on 8:30pm on a thursday night. Right before it started i
            remembered how much i hate ryan reynolds as deadpool and i walked out feeling empty. Like the movie had
            robbed me of 2 hours and had nothing to show from it. Its now 11:51pm and im listening to music and drinking
            a tea to try and wind down for bed because the comic book movie was so atrocious. I liked the first dead
            pool movie. But also that was 2016 and i was 19. The 2nd one was in 2018 and i was 21 and found the entire
            thing rather grating. Now its 2024. Im 27 and im far to fucking old for a deadpool thats still trying to be
            like its 2016</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <h1>Some good things i watched</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>I found a link (by asking someone on reddit very nicely) to an
                bootleg of the new merrily we roll along that just closed and its fantastic</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Black friday (starkid) - im still not sure how i feel about the
                horror hatcherfield musicals starkid are doing but i enjoyed this (i think my problem is theres no clear
                protagonist setup early on? Like this has smoker kid and also old man but they dip in terms of who feels
                like the main character)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>The fall guy - fine movie. But its filmed in sydney and therefore
                the chase scenes pissed me off to no end because i could tell the route they were taking and it made no
                sense there was just a big loop</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Little women at hayes - i don&#39;t think i can hate anything
                they produce</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Deadpool and wolverine - see above</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Moving out???</h1>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">So I started writing this last week and was worried there&#39;d be nothing to talk
            about but I guess now I&#39;m moving out? It&#39;s currently Monday the 29th at 1pm and I&#39;m currently
            stuck in my work office having a slight panic attack. Just from sheer &ldquo;wait what have I just signed up
            for???&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">So anyway thats gonna be that</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Until next month</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jack out</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">(im thinking of watching mordecai again which feels like a cry for help but also if
            anyone wants to watch it with me ewen mcgreggor truly tries to cuck his wife its hilarious)</span></p>
